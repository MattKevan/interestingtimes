This is the eighth in an amazing series of woodcut prints by Paul Nash, illustrating the first chapter of Genesis.

&quot;And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.&quot;

Paul Nash (11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.

The prints in this set were first published in 1924 by Nonesuch Press as &#39;Genesis – Twelve woodcuts by Paul Nash with the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version&#39;.
