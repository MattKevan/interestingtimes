This is the second in an amazing series of woodcut prints by Paul Nash, illustrating the first chapter of Genesis.

&quot;And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.&quot;

Paul Nash (11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.

The prints in this set were first published in 1924 by Nonesuch Press as &#39;Genesis – Twelve woodcuts by Paul Nash with the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version&#39;.
