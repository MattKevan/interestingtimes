This is the tenth plate from a collection of 20 stunning butterfly prints by E A Seguy.

Eugene Alain Seguy was one of the leading French designers at the beginning of the 20th century, working in both the Art Deco and Art Nouveau styles. He published eleven albums of nature-themed work using the pochoir technique, a printing process which involves hand-colouring a large number of stencils - up to 100 for a single print -  to produce solid, bold colours.
