This is the eighth plate from a collection of 20 stunning butterfly prints by E A Seguy.

Eugene Alain Seguy was one of the leading French designers at the beginning of the 20th century, working in both the Art Deco and Art Nouveau styles. He published eleven albums of nature-themed work using the pochoir technique, a printing process which involves hand-colouring a large number of stencils - up to 100 for a single print -  to produce solid, bold colours.

### Printing

We use acid-free archival watercolour paper, an extremely high quality paper with a lovely texture, which looks fantastic and brings out the best in your artwork. With care, your print will look fantastic for many years.

Prints have a 0.5-1&quot; white border around the edges to allow for easy framing, but you have a specific size requirement, get in touch â€“ we&#39;re always happy to help.

### Shipping and delivery

When posting, we&#39;ll carefully pack your prints in a mailing tube or stiff envelope to keep them safe, and we aim have them on their way to you within 2-7 days of receiving your payment.

Please note that the actual item colours shown may be different from the photos above due to different monitor settings, and the frame shown is for illustrative purposes only.
