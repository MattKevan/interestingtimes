This is the first in an amazing series of woodcut prints by Paul Nash, illustrating the first chapter of Genesis.

&quot;And the darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters&quot;

Paul Nash (11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.

The prints in this set were first published in 1924 by Nonesuch Press as &#39;Genesis – Twelve woodcuts by Paul Nash with the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version&#39;.
