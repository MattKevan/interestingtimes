This is the eighth in an amazing series of woodcut prints by Paul Nash, illustrating the first chapter of Genesis.

&quot;And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.&quot;

Paul Nash (11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.

The prints in this set were first published in 1924 by Nonesuch Press as &#39;Genesis – Twelve woodcuts by Paul Nash with the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version&#39;.
