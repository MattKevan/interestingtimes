Small Teasel (Cephalaria). Enlarged 10 times. Plate 77.

This is a high-quality print from Karl Blossfeldt&#39;s groundbreaking work &#39;Urformen der Kunst&#39; first published in 1928. A 1929 English edition was published as &#39;Art Forms in Nature&#39;. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld &#39;has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world’.
