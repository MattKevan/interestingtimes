This is the second in the &#39;Kleine Welten (Small Worlds)&#39; series of 12 prints, published in 1922, shortly after Kandinsky started teaching at the Bauhaus. The series comprises of four woodcut prints, four etchings and four lithographs, each piece tailored to the medium&#39;s unique characteristics.

Born in 1866, Vasily Kandinsky taught at the Bauhaus and is credited with creating one of the first abstract artworks.

### Printing

Prints are available in 8x10&quot; and 11x14&quot; sizes, with a white border around the edges to allow for easy framing. If you have a specific size requirement, get in touch â€“ we&#39;re always happy to help.

We use 200gsm enhanced matt art paper, an extremely high quality paper with a lovely texture, which looks fantastic and brings out the best in your artwork. With care, your print will look fantastic for many years!
