This is the fifth in an amazing series of woodcut prints by Paul Nash, illustrating the first chapter of Genesis.

&quot;And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day.&quot;

Paul Nash (11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.

The prints in this set were first published in 1924 by Nonesuch Press as &#39;Genesis – Twelve woodcuts by Paul Nash with the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version&#39;.
