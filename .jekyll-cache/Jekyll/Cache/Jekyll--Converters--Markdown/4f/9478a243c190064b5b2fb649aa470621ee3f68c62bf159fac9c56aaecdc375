I"U	<p>This is the sixth in an amazing series of woodcut prints by Paul Nash, illustrating the first chapter of Genesis.</p>

<p>"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also."</p>

<p>Paul Nash (11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.</p>

<p>The prints in this set were first published in 1924 by Nonesuch Press as 'Genesis – Twelve woodcuts by Paul Nash with the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version'.</p>
