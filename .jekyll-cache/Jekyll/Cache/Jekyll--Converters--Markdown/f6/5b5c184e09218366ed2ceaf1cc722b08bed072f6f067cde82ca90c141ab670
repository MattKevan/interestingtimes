<p>This is a high-quality print from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst' first published in 1928. A 1929 English edition was published as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.</p>

<p>Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.</p>

<p>The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld 'has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the worldâ€™.</p>
