I"¿<p>This is the fourth in an amazing series of woodcut prints by Paul Nash, illustrating the first chapter of Genesis.</p>

<p>"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good."</p>

<p>Paul Nash (11 May 1889 â€“ 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.</p>

<p>The prints in this set were first published in 1924 by Nonesuch Press as 'Genesis â€“ Twelve woodcuts by Paul Nash with the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version'.</p>
