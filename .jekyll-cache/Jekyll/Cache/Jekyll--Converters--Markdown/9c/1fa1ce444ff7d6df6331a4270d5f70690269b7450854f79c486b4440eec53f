I"Æ<p>Produced during a period when Nash regarded himself as â€˜a war artist without a warâ€™, it is now recognised as a high point in his artistic output and one of the most significant illustrated books of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>To accompany the Creation story described in the opening chapter of the Book of Genesis, Nash cut a series of twelve wood engravings of astonishing power. Starting with a solid black evocation of The Void, his stark images gradually emerge from primordial darkness into divine light, dynamic semi-abstract forms evoking the mystery of the appearance of the universe at Godâ€™s command.</p>
