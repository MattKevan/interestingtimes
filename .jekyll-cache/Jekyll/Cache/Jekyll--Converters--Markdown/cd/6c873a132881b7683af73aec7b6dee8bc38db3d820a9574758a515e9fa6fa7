I"≈<p>Housed by the United States National Agricultural Library, it is a unique resource documenting existing fruit and nut cultivars, new introductions, and specimens discovered by USDA‚Äôs plant explorers, representing 38 plant families in all.] It has been called ‚Äúone of the world‚Äôs most unusual holdings of late 19th and early 20th century American botanical illustrations‚Äù.</p>

<p>The archive spans the years in which American agriculture greatly expanded the range of fruits and vegetables grown on a commercial scale and developed many new cultivars. The USDA artists created the watercolors in an effort to catalog these cultivars‚Äîmany of which went under different names in different regions of the United States‚Äîand to show the damage resulting from typical diseases and pests of specific fruits. During this period, many of the watercolors were issued as lithographic illustrations in USDA bulletins and the department‚Äôs annual yearbooks.</p>
