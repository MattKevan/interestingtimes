I"$<p>This is the first in an amazing series of woodcut prints by Paul Nash, illustrating the first chapter of Genesis.</p>

<p>"And the darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters"</p>

<p>Paul Nash (11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.</p>

<p>The prints in this set were first published in 1924 by Nonesuch Press as 'Genesis – Twelve woodcuts by Paul Nash with the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version'.</p>
