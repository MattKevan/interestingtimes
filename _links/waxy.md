Launched in 2002, Waxy.org is my personal sandbox — a place for my writing, research, and explorations of the web. Frequent topics include internet culture, copyright and fair use, online community, independent and experimental media, and the intersection of art and technology.

In the process, I’ve occasionally found myself in the news. I found (and named) the Star Wars Kid, coined the “supercut” genre of videos, was the first to put the Danger Mouse’s Grey Album on the web (and first to be cease-and-desisted for it), and tracked the piracy of Oscars screeners for over a decade.
