"Let There Be Lights in the Firmament by Paul Nash – Genesis woodcut print","This is the sixth in an amazing series of woodcut prints by Paul Nash, illustrating the first chapter of Genesis.

""And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.""

Paul Nash (11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.

The prints in this set were first published in 1924 by Nonesuch Press as 'Genesis – Twelve woodcuts by Paul Nash with the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version'.

"Arbor Vitae - Plate 29 | From Urformen Der Kunst by Karl Blossfeldt | Vintage botanical photographic print","Thujopsis Dolabrata. Hatchet-Leaved Arbor Vitae. Ends of a branch enlarged 10 times.

This is a print of plate 29 from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"".

"Flowering Ash - Plate 9 | Urformen der Kunst | Karl Blossfeldt |  Botanical print, wall art, room decor, black & white, sepia, vintage","Callicarpa dichotoma: enlarged 7 times. 
Fraxinus ornus. Flowering Ash: enlarged 6 times. 
Cornus pubescens. Dogwood: enlarged 8 times.

This is a print of plate 9 from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"".

"Indian Balsam - Plate 19 | Urformen der Kunst | Karl Blossfeldt | Botanical print, wall art, room decor, black & white, sepia, vintage","Impatiens glanduligera. Hardy Indian Balsam. Stem with ramifications: natural size.

This is a print of plate 19 from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"".

"Saxifrage Leaf - Plate 35 | From Urformen Der Kunst by Karl Blossfeldt | Vintage botanical photographic print","Saxifraga Willkommniana. Willkomm's Saxifrage. Leaf enlarged 18 times.

This is a print of plate 35 from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"".

"Lime Mallow - Plate 63 | From Urformen Der Kunst by Karl Blossfeldt | Vintage botanical photographic print","Lime Mallow (Abutilon). Enlarged 12 times. Plate 63.

This is a high-quality print from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst' first published in 1928. A 1929 English edition was published as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld 'has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world’.

""And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.""

Paul Nash (11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.

The prints in this set were first published in 1924 by Nonesuch Press as 'Genesis – Twelve woodcuts by Paul Nash with the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version'.

"Compass Plant - Plate 41 | Urformen der Kunst | Karl Blossfeldt | Botanical print, wall art, room decor, black & white, sepia, vintage","Silphium Laciniatum. Compass Plant. Leaf dried on the stem enlarged 5 times.

This is a print of plate 41 from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"".

"And God set them in the heavens Genesis Bible print, Paul Nash |  Woodcut engraving, art, Bible, high quality print, black & white","This is the seventh in an amazing series of woodcut prints by Paul Nash, illustrating the first chapter of Genesis.

""And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.""

Paul Nash (11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.

The prints in this set were first published in 1924 by Nonesuch Press as 'Genesis – Twelve woodcuts by Paul Nash with the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version'.

Vaccinium Corymbosum. Common or Swamp Blueberry. Bunch of fruit enlarged 8 times. Polystichum Falcatum. Prickly Shield-fern. Young rolled-up frond enlarged 5 times.

This is a print of plate 33 from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"".

"Arbor Vitae – Plate 67 | From Urformen Der Kunst by Karl Blossfeldt | Vintage botanical photographic print","Arbor Vitae and Common Rue, enlarged 10 times.

This is a print from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"".

"Maple Tree - Plate 22 | Urformen der Kunst | Karl Blossfeldt |    Botanical print, wall art, room decor, black & white, sepia, vintage","Acer Rufinerve. Maple Tree. Shoots enlarged 10 times.

This is a print of plate 22 from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"". 

### Printing

Prints are available in a range of sizes, with a white border around the edges to allow for easy framing. If you have a specific size requirement, get in touch – we're always happy to help.

We use 200gsm enhanced matt art paper, an extremely high quality paper with a lovely texture, which looks fantastic and brings out the best in your artwork. With care, your print will look fantastic for many years!

### Shipping and delivery

When posting, we'll carefully pack your prints in a mailing tube or stiff envelope to keep them safe, and we aim have them on their way to you within 3-7 days of receiving your payment.

Please note that the actual item colours shown may be different from the photos above due to different monitor settings, and the frame shown is for illustrative purposes only.

"Canadian Vervain - Plate 39 | Urformen der Kunst | Karl Blossfeldt | Botanical print, wall art, room decor, black & white, sepia, vintage","Canadian Vervain (Verbena canadensis). Leaf enlarged 10 times. Plate 39.

This is a print of plate 39 from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"".
